                    PJ has been involved with running and strength training for most of his life. His passion for running and lifing 
                    grew out of an interest in enhancing performance and preventing injuries.

                     we were yesterday. He also believes that with a smart approach, along with some good old fashion 
                     grit and hard work, anyone can reach their goals
